> **The MRI Scanner for Your Domains.** 🚀

A powerful, **full-stack diagnostic tool** that performs deep health checks on thousands of domains in seconds. It allows you to analyze security protocols (SPF, DMARC, DKIM), server health, and blacklist status—all running locally on your machine with **zero cost** and **maximized privacy**.

## ✨ What Makes This Special?

Unlike simple lookup tools, this application acts as a complete **Bulk Analysis Engine**. It doesn't just read records; it **simulates** real-world email and web traffic to give you 100% accurate results.

### 🔥 Power Features

*   **⚡ Bulk Processing Beast**: Upload an Excel file with **1,000+ domains** and watch them process in real-time.
*   **🛑 Smart Controls**:
    *   **Pause & Resume**: Need a break? Pause the batch instantly and resume exactly where you left off.
    *   **Instant Kill Switch**: Stop the entire operation immediately with zero lag.
*   **🛡️ Deep Security analysis**:
    *   **SPF**: Checks for syntax errors, lookup limits, and strictness.
    *   **DMARC**: Validates policy enforcement (`p=reject`) to prevent spoofing.
    *   **DKIM**: Probes standard keys to ensure email authenticity.
*   **🚫 Blacklist Monitor**: Checks your IP against major anti-spam lists (Spamhaus, Sorbs, Spamcop).
*   **📊 Excel Export**: One-click export of "Clean" vs "Error" domains for easy reporting.

## 🚀 How It Works

We bypass expensive 3rd-party APIs by using **Native Node.js Networking**:

1.  **DNS Direct**: We query authoritative nameservers directly for raw, uncached data.
2.  **SMTP Handshake**: We connect to the Mail Server (port 25/587) to "say hello" and verify it's active, without ever sending an email.
3.  **Web Simulation**: We act like a web browser to check if your site is secure (HTTPS) and loads correctly.

All of this happens in **Parallel** (up to 50 concurrent checks) for lightning-fast speeds.
